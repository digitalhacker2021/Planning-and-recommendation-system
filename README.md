# Planning-and-recommendation-system
# Project Description:
•	Please view our Git hub page for a comprehensive project profile: digitalhacker2021/Planning-and-recommendation-system (github.com)

•	Covid-19 has changed the course of history, today our world is grappling with unprecedented situation.
•	There is waves after waves of infection and no one is sure for how long this situation is going to continue
•	World over the Planning departments of governments are struggling to find the correct balance on when to hit the Pause button and when to restart, the economic activity.
•	We intent to assist the planning department by deploying intelligent technology solution, which not only predicts the trend of the Covid, but also recommends when to begin Lockdown and when to commence unlock.
•	The recommendations are based on deploying artificial intelligence to forecast Typical Covid wave patterns and then applying a logic to provide recommendation to City wide planning department on a predefined department policy.
•	Our solution has 3 basic parts
o	Screen Flow, which guides the user towards Prediction and recommendation process flow.
o	Prediction Engine, is the Artificial intelligence driven system, which predicts the Covid wave patterns and Vaccination coverage forecast, based on the historical data and real time data stream
o	Recommendation Engine, this considers inputs from Prediction Engine forecast and Policy guidelines from Department to suggest the next best action for the department

# Data Story:
•	The first confirmed case in Australia was identified on 25 January 2020. In the first wave, the country experienced a huge rise in cases, then levelled out at about 350 per day around 22 March and started falling at the beginning of April to under 20 cases per day by the end of the month.
•	Till date, Australia has reported more than 40,000 cases, 25,000 recoveries, and 900 deaths.
•	Due to the pandemic, restaurants, shopping malls, schools, universities likewise other public gathering places have been shut down and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost.
•	Mostly the actions by planning departments are reactive in nature and results in massive losses towards lives and livelihood. 
•	Therefore, Road to recovery is often patchy and full of potholes. 
•	Currently third wave is ongoing in Australia and so far, 29.6% of the people are fully vaccinated while 51.8% of the people got their first jab done. But still planning departments have to tread caution and have to ensure the fine balance between lives and livelihood. 
•	Our prediction and recommendation Engine assist by, analyzing the records of the Covid waves that occurred in the past for other countries of similar Demography.
•	After analyzing, our system makes predictions of the Covid wave pattern, 7 days moving average, vaccination coverage forecast and accordingly recommend to the Department proactive precautionary actions like begin Lockdown, continue Lockdown, or begin unlocking in a phased wise approach.
